# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Troubleshooting

This repository contains examples of uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and their solutions.  These errors often go beyond the typical dependency issues and require more in-depth troubleshooting.

## Examples

* **Example 1:**  An obscure error related to incorrect configuration of the `app.json` file, leading to build failures.
* **Example 2:** A server startup issue related to port conflicts or unexpected system limitations.
* **Example 3:**  An error during the build process related to a specific native module or dependency incompatibility.

Each example includes the problematic code snippet (`expoBug.js`) and a corresponding solution (`expoBugSolution.js`).
