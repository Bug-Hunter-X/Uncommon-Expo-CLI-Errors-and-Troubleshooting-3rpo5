The solution often involves careful examination of the Expo CLI logs, checking for conflicting dependencies (using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`), reviewing the app's configuration files (`app.json`, `package.json`), and ensuring all necessary native modules are correctly installed and linked. In some cases, creating a new project and migrating the code may be necessary.  If dealing with native modules, cleaning the build folders may resolve temporary issues.  Always consult Expo's official documentation for the most up-to-date troubleshooting information.
